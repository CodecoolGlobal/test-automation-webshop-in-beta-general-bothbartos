## About The Project

This project is a Selenium-Java based test automation framework designed to test the functionality
and performance of an online webshop. The goal of this project is to ensure the webshop operates
seamlessly, providing a smooth and reliable user experience for customers. By automating critical
test cases, the project helps maintain the webshop's reliability, security, and responsiveness.

## The System Under Test - [Swag Labs][swag-labs-url]

Swag Labs is a demo e-commerce website designed for testing and practicing web automation techniques.
It simulates a fully functional online store where users can log in, browse products, add items to
their shopping cart, and proceed through a checkout process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher**
    - Ensure that you have Java installed on your system, as the project is based on Java. You can download the JDK
      from [Oracle's official website][oracle-url] or use a package manager like sdkman or Homebrew (on macOS).

To verify installation, run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
java -version
```

2. **Apache Maven**
    - Maven is used to manage dependencies and automate builds. Youâ€™ll need to have it installed to run the project.

    - Download and install Maven from [here] [Maven-url].
    - Check if Maven is installed by running:

```shell
mvn -version
```

3. **Chrome Browser**
    - The project uses ChromeDriver for running Selenium tests, so you need to have Google Chrome installed.
    - You can download it from [here][chrome-url].

4. **ChromeDriver**
    - ChromeDriver is required to control Chrome via Selenium. Make sure you download the correct version of
      ChromeDriver that matches your installed Chrome browser version.
    - Download ChromeDriver from the official site: [ChromeDriver Downloads][chrome-driver-url]
    - Ensure ChromeDriver is either included in your PATH or the project is configured to point to its location.

5. **JUnit**
   - JUnit is used as the testing framework. It will be managed **automatically** by **Maven** through the pom.xml file, but you can verify that the correct version is included.
